If you believe an item not authentic, we will need documentation from a professional stating otherwise. All authenticated items will be shipped with a copy of Authenticate First&rsquo;s email.    Items not labeled Authentic are determined by our fashion specialist, at the best of their ability, to not be fake. IF you suspect that an item listed or received is fake, please contact us with specific documentation verifying that the item is fake.    **Gemstone Disclaimer**    *&ldquo;Gemstones&rdquo; are stones which have tested in the &ldquo;gemstone&rdquo; range on a Presidium Gemstone Tester. Gemstones may be lab created or natural. We cannot guarantee specific gemstone names through this test.    *DIAMONDS have been tested with Presidium Gemstone Tester. Through this test we cannot distinguish diamonds from moissanite.

They CAN have magnetic attraction AND hold their marked purity. Note that Rhodium plating will result in a magnetic pull on an item. Also, clasps usually have ferrous springs inside.  &bull;          If you acid test your jewelry please keep in mind that many pieces are plated. Rhodium (on white gold or silver) and Gold (on silver) are thick. Not scratching past this will read a false negative. Also, PLEASE scratch only in discreet places. White & Rose gold will not hold as strong to acid as yellow gold.  &bull;          If you take the jewelry to a jeweler to be tested, be sure that they are thorough and can be trusted. We have had several items which were claimed to have been tested by a jeweler as false, yet our testing still showed the precious metal content of the jewelry.  If you determine that the jewelry you received is not Silver or Gold as claimed, we will email you a return label so we may retest it. If the metal is in fact as it was described, we will hold the item until the round trip postage is paid (usually $6). If the precious metal content was not as described, we will issue you a full refund, and an apology.      This is a USED item donated to Goodwill of Southern New Jersey & Philadelphia.

Gemstones may be lab created or natural. We cannot guarantee specific gemstone names through this test.    *DIAMONDS have been tested with Presidium Gemstone Tester. Through this test we cannot distinguish diamonds from moissanite. No refunds will be issued for moissanite.      *TURQUOISE &ldquo;Stones&rdquo; &ndash; 96 of turquoise gemstones on the market are stabilized, increasing durability, reshaping the stone, dying, and/or enhancing color. We cannot determine the nature of turquoise stones. The only refund we will give on turquoise stones is if they are documented and proven as plastic or glass, opposed to a mineral.      *PEARLS &ndash; We have no way to tell the nature of a pearl (if it is &ldquo;natural&rdquo; vs cultivated). If it is fake, it will be labeled FAUX. If it may be natural or cultivated, it will be called GENUINE.      *AMBER RESIN are determined to be an organic by-product (ie not plastic) and we cannot make any statement as to age or if it has fossilized.      *BAKELITE has been identified via the scrubbing bubbles test       Precious Metal Testing:  All gold & silver has been tested using JSP acid solution to verify purity.    &bull;          Sterling Silver & Gold Jewelry are ALLOYS. They CAN have magnetic attraction AND hold their marked purity. Note that Rhodium plating will result in a magnetic pull on an item. Also, clasps usually have ferrous springs inside.  &bull;          If you acid test your jewelry please keep in mind that many pieces are plated. Rhodium (on white gold or silver) and Gold (on silver) are thick. Not scratching past this will read a false negative. Also, PLEASE scratch only in discreet places. White & Rose gold will not hold as strong to acid as yellow gold.  &bull;          If you take the jewelry to a jeweler to be tested, be sure that they are thorough and can be trusted. We have had several items which were claimed to have been tested by a jeweler as false, yet our testing still showed the precious metal content of the jewelry.  If you determine that the jewelry you received is not Silver or Gold as claimed, we will email you a return label so we may retest it. If the metal is in fact as it was described, we will hold the item until the round trip postage is paid (usually $6). If the precious metal content was not as described, we will issue you a full refund, and an apology.      This is a USED item donated to Goodwill of Southern New Jersey & Philadelphia.    Please see images for further detail. Item may contain unnoticed flaws. Sold AS-IS. Ask any questions you may have BEFORE making a bid. No Refunds.
